If the PCs just close the bag after finding the dead cat, it will start wiggling and crying again. Any time the bag is opened, flip a coin again.

1072. The wind holds a scrap of paper against a tree. The paper turns out to be a wanted poster offering a hefty sum for one of the PCs. The party has never been near the town offering the reward.

1102. Flowing magma is not a threat at this distance. Still, the pungent scent in the air can only worsen if you continue on this path.
1103. A small pouch showing a crest or emblem lies near the road. It contains lead figurines of exquisite detail and in realistic poses.
1104. Two small children stand all alone beside the road. They are dirty and the youngest one cries easily. They wait for their parents to return. They do not know why their parents left.
1105. Poles with impaled rotting heads line the sides of the road.

1110. Several beautiful drunk women stumble out of the bush and mistake the PCs for wealthy merchants.

1116. You are crossing a bridge when, suddenly, from behind one of the bridge's pillars, a man steps out and demands you pay a toll to cross. You ask by what authority does he collect the toll and the man produces a dubious looking bit of vellum with what appears to be the King's seal stamped upon it.

1136. Four goblins clad in loin cloths burst out of the bushes and accost the party with piteous cries. They beg the party to rescue them from pursuing slavers. Seconds later the party hears creatures fast approaching. 
1137. As though from the blue, a large volley of arrows falls down among the party as they travel along the road, but the attack is not repeated.
1138. See it? says the scout. "You must stand just so." Assuming the position, you can see what the scout sees - an odd portal showing through to some blasted landscape, floating in the air alongside the road, visible only from this one place.
1139. A large area of the road in front of you is covered with a thin layer of ashes and soot. You hear crackling from above and look up just in time to see a fireball come down towards you.

1163. A large herd of cattle cross the road in front of you. As they cross, they become spooked, for reasons unknown, and begin to stampede.

1165. An earthquake shakes the area and tears a rift in the roadway. The rift might be a small crack or as drastic as a 20 foot shift (1906 San Fran earthquake, for example). This event should have impacts further down the road (on settlements, other travelers, other encounters).
1166. In an area of volcanic springs, clouds of venting steam and jets of boiling sulfurous water burst from the ground.

1169. Five cowled monks on a pilgrimage kneel in the middle of the road, praying softly.

1177. A mob of villagers flee the brigands who burnt down their homes.

1191. A group of peasants are met travelling to the market in the next town. They offer cheap produce.
1192. The road is lined with criminals chained to stocks, with only hands and heads poking through. A visible punishment for wrongdoers. Many of the criminals shout they are innocent. Is this land corrupt or are the laws justly doled out here?
1193. A group of well-to-do merchants rest beside the road.
1194. The PCs find a voodoo doll the looks like someone they know.

1199. A smouldering unattended campfire starts to burn the roots of a nearby tree.

1205. As you negotiate the winding mountain pass you feel a tremor through your feet. Instants later, it becomes a rumble then a roar as rocks begin to fall around you.
1206. What's that? A pale and dead body bobs up and down in the nearby river. Perhaps an aquatic predator killed and stashed it underwater for future meals, and it has floated up.
1207. While you rest alongside the road, a pair of bear cubs wander out playfully towards you, questing for food. Ominous growls sound behind them as the bushes part to reveal the mother, hurtling towards you.

1236. A ghost blocks passage.
1237. An approaching funeral procession takes up the whole road, forcing the PCs off the road.
1238. The PCs come to a rough and crumbly road. The ground was disturbed recently by a bulette and the PCs may fall into an empty tunnel, an occupied tunnel (by the bulette or something taking advantage of the tunnel), or just find the road travel difficult.

(If successful, the PC runs off into the night, leading the party to a cave-in that claimed the ghosts' life, hoping the party will complete his long forgotten quest and allow his spirit to rest. If the possession fails, he beckons the party to follow. If they do not, he flies into a rage and attacks.)

1304. Noxious, bilious green gas covers the road ahead.
1305. An older gentleman hobbles along, apparently injured. If asked, he admits to being caught unawares and attacked by brigands and mumbles he should have known better.

1306. A young dog or other creature decides to playfully follow the party.
1307. A tree with bark chewed or clawed off at the bottom.

1328. A woman on the road yells for help, saying bandits robbed her and her husband and left her husband for dead. She leads the PCs to her husband who is close to death and needs immediate medical attention. If he dies then the party has gained a hanger-on they have to take to at least the next town, if not all the way home.

1335. Flies are buzzing around a shoe containing a foot in front of you.

1344. A road sign saying where you came from is ahead of you.
1345. A group of guardsmen hang wanted posters on trees. One face looks familiar to a PC.

1348. A huge nest has fallen from a tree on the side of the road, and the strange-looking eggs within seem on the verge of hatching.

1354. A wind elemental likes to cause havoc along this road. Several travelers have warned you and authorities of the threat, yet the officials only answer with, "Whatever blows your skirt up."

1358. A large dragon circles overhead like a hawk hunts for prey.
1359. A Tyrannosaurus rex chases down a triceratops.
